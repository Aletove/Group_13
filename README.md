# Group_13
This project ismade in two separate versions
- command-line version
- Ui version
#Command Line Version
The command-line game works completely, with it you can play a whole game
with a minimum of 2 players and a maximum of 4 players.
We tested several game scenarios, one and two CommonGoal and one
PersonalGoal, the game works well and the events are handled correctly.
#Ui Version
The user interface of the game shows a landing page to start a game and add
players, in the bottom left corner the names of the players are shown.
Starting the game shows the game board, common goals, personal goal and
personal shelf.
We implemented the game board and the image of the tiles on it.
The game version does not handle events that change the user interface.
